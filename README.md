# Java_mobile_agents
Implementation of simple container of mobile agents based on Java RMI.

Implement a simple container of mobile agents based on Java RMI. The container should be able to host a mobile agent and to run it. A specific primitive supported by the container should enable the migration from a container instance to another one. Implement weak mobility (the agent starts the execution from the first statement whenever it arrives onto a new node/container). With this approach, mobility transparency is not ensured.
